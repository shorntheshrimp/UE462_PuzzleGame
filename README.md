# UnrealEngineGame_PuzzleGame
The Untitled Puzzle Game is a 3D single-player Puzzle windows game developed with C++ via Unreal Engine 4.26. The player can choose to switch between the two charactors to traverse the world and solve the puzzles in them by utilizing each charactor's unique characteristics. 

# How to get it working?
Install Unreal Engine 4.26.2 in Epic Games software. There are a bunch of VS files amongst others to reduce file size due to github's 1GB limitation, start of by regenerating visual studios C++ files by right-clicking the .uproject file in the main folder and selecting "Generate Visual Studio Project Files" under the dropdown options. After opening project in Unreal Engine, reload visual studio files under File -> reload visual studio files for good measure. Might have to reload certain materials or textures manually. Enjoy!
